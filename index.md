Thank you for your interest in my website.

I'm a public finance economist with a strong interest in data analysis, econometrics, and R. Unfortunately, you caught me in the middle of a website redesign. Please check back again soon. You can email me at <mailto:icha@ksu.edu> if you have questions about the data analysis I've done or my publications.
